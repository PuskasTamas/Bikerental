# Description of create of the order of database.

**Highly recommended running Bikerental.exe desktop application on Windows.  
It creates the database completely with your paths and datas.**

The *basics_database* folder contains the main SQL scripts of database:  
1. **Create_db_main.sql**  
It creates *.mdf* and *.ldf* files.  
If you want to run it separately you have to replace *@pathdatabase* variable with your path.  
2. **Create_tables_indexes.sql**  
It creates tables and indexes.
3. **Create_login.sql**  
It creates few login names with authorizations.
4. **insert_values.sql**  
I wonder what can do this for? ðŸ˜ƒ
