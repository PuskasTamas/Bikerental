# Bikerental
This is a bike rental database.

First you have to save all files and directories to SOMEWHERE on your computer.

Highly recommend you run **Bikerental.exe** desktop application on Windows.  
It builds up the database completely with your paths and datas.

The *schema.jpg* shows the structure of the database.

The *Create Bikerental database.md* describes how order you have to run the scripts  
that you can build up the main part of the database if you want to create it yourself.
