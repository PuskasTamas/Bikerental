# Bikerental database for SQL Server
This database can manage a bike rental service in many branches.  
It handles customers' and employees' personal datas,  
purchases of bikes,  
details of rentals,  
it stores types, prices, quantities of bikes for hire  
and it even contains the information of maintenances of bikes.

### Auto install the database with desktop application
1. First you have to save all files and directories to a folder SOMEWHERE on your computer.  
2. Run **Bikerental.exe** desktop application on Windows.  
It builds up the database completely with your paths and datas.  
It creates backup agent files with timestamps in their names, too.

### Manually install the database
*Create Bikerental database.md* describes the order in which the files should be run  
if you want to create the database yourself.

#### Schema.jpg shows the structure of the database.

#### Bikerental.exe Windows desktop application was developed by myself in C# WPF.
